# Add radio buttons to PDF document in C# and VB.NET
This sample shows how to use radio buttons in your PDF document with [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

You can add radio buttons to your PDF document using [PdfPage.AddRadioButton methods](https://api.docotic.com/pdfpage-addradiobutton).
These methods return an instance of the [PdfRadionButton class](https://api.docotic.com/pdfradiobutton).

The [PdfRadioButton.ExportValue property](https://api.docotic.com/pdfradiobutton-exportvalue) is used to specify a value to be exported
when a submit form action is activated. Look at the [Use Submit and Reset form actions in PDF documents](/Samples/Actions/SubmitResetFormActions) sample
for more detail about the submit form action.
