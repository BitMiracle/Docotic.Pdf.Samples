This sample shows how to remove widgets from your PDF documents using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

## Description

There are two ways to remove widgets. You can use the [PdfPage.Widgets](https://api.docotic.com/pdfpage-widgets) property to access the collection of a page widgets. Then use the [Remove](https://api.docotic.com/pdfwidgetcollection-remove), [RemoveAt](https://api.docotic.com/pdfwidgetcollection-removeat), and [Clear](https://api.docotic.com/pdfwidgetcollection-clear) methods of the [PdfWidgetCollection](https://api.docotic.com/pdfwidgetcollection) class to remove the widgets you donâ€™t need.
