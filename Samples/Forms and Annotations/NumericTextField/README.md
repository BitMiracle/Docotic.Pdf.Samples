# Numeric text fields
This sample shows how to create text fields that allow only digits to be input with the help of [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

## Description

Numeric text fields require a special JavaScript action associated with the [PdfTextBox.OnKeyPress](https://api.docotic.com/pdfcontrol-onkeypress) event. The action will filter out any non-digit character input in the text field. 

NOTE: This will only work if Javascript is supported and turned on in your PDF viewer.
