# Permissions
This sample shows how to setup user acess permissions for a PDF document.

To setup user access permissions, the document must be encrypted.

When encrypting with a password, there are two password types: "user" and "owner" passwords. Opening a PDF document with an "owner" password allows to do everything with the opened document. Opening a PDF document with a "user" password allows only operations specified by the user access permissions. 

User access permissions may be used to disallow printing of document, filling of form fields or other operations.
