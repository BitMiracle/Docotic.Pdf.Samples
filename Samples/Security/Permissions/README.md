# Permissions
This sample shows how to set up user access permissions for a PDF document in C# and VB.NET.

The document must be encrypted in order to set up user access permissions.

When encrypting with a password, there are two password types: "user" and "owner" passwords. Opening a PDF document with an "owner" password allows you to do everything with the opened document. Opening a PDF document with a "user" password allows only operations specified by the user [access permissions](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/help/pdfpermissions.html). 

User access permissions may be used to disallow printing of the document, filling of form fields, or other operations.
