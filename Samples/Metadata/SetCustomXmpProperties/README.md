# Set custom XMP metadata properties in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to change custom, application-defined metadata properties of a PDF document using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/). 

## Description

Docotic.Pdf can read and set strings, arrays of different types, and structures as custom properties. To access custom metadata properties of a PDF document, first get the [XmpMetadata](https://api.docotic.com/xmpmetadata) object from the [PdfDocument.Metadata](https://api.docotic.com/pdfdocument-metadata) property, then use the [Custom](https://api.docotic.com/xmpmetadata-custom) property of the object.
