# Set the text rise in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to adjust the baseline of text using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/). 

## Description

Changing the baseline is useful for drawing superscripts or subscripts.

Text rise specifies the distance to move the baseline up or down from its default location. A positive value for the [PdfCanvas.TextRise](https://api.docotic.com/pdfcanvas-textrise) property moves the baseline up, a negative value moves the baseline down.
