# Choose the way to render PDF text in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to specify the text rendering mode on a PDF canvas using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

## Description

The text rendering mode specifies whether drawing text causes glyph outlines to be stroked, filled, used as a clipping boundary, or some combination of the three. It is also possible to add invisible text to PDF. 

Use the [PdfCanvas.TextRenderingMode](https://api.docotic.com/pdfcanvas-textrenderingmode) property to set the desired rendering mode for a canvas. See the [PdfTextRenderingMode](https://api.docotic.com/pdftextrenderingmode) enumeration of the modes.
