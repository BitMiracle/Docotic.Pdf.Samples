# Copy pages
This sample shows how to copy pages from one PDF document to another using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

## Description

Use one of the [PdfDocument.CopyPages](https://api.docotic.com/pdfdocument-copypages) methods in your C# or VB.NET code to make a copy of PDF pages without changing the source document.

Call the [PdfDocument.RemoveUnusedResources](https://api.docotic.com/pdfdocument-removeunusedresources) method on the copy to make sure the copied pages do not reference unused resources such as fonts or images.
