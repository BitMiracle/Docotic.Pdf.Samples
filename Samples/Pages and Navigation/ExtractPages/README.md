# Extract PDF pages in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to extract pages from a PDF document, creating a new PDF document.

## Description

Use [PdfDocument.ExtractPages](https://api.docotic.com/pdfdocument-extractpages) methods to create a new document with extracted pages. [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/) throws an exception if you try to extract pages from a document that contains only one page.
