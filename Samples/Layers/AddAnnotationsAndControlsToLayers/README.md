# Add annotations and controls to layers
This samples shows how to add annotations (widgets) and controls to layers in a PDF document.

All widget and control classes have Layer property. All you need to do to associate a widget or
a control with a layer is to assign the layer to the property. 

To remove a widget or a control from a layer you only need to set the widget / control Layer property to null.
