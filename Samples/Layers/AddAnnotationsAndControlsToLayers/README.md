# Add annotations and controls to PDF layers in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to add annotations (widgets) and controls to layers in a PDF document using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

## Description

All widget and control classes have the [Layer](https://api.docotic.com/pdfwidget-layer) property. To associate a widget or a control with a layer, you only need to assign the layer to the property.

To remove a widget or a control from a layer, just set the widget / control `Layer` property to `null`.
