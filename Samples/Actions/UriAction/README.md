# Use URI action in PDF documents
This sample shows how to create a URI action using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

Use [PdfDocument.CreateHyperlinkAction methods](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/api/pdfdocument-createhyperlinkaction) to create a URI action.
You can then associate the URI action with bookmarks, action areas, or PDF controls.

A URI action causes a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) to be resolved.
