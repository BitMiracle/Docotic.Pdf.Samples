# Submit and Reset Form Actions
This sample shows how to use Submit-Form and Reset-Form actions.

A Submit-Form action (PdfSubmitFormAction class) transmits the names and values of associated controls to a specified uniform resource identifier (URI), presumably the address of a Web server that will process them and send back a response.

A Reset-Form action (PdfResetFormAction class) resets associated controls to their default values.

Please use AddControl method to associate a control with a Submit-Form or a Reset-Form action.
