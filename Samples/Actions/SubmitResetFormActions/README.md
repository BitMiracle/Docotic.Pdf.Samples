# Use Submit and Reset form actions in PDF documents
This sample shows how to use Submit-Form and Reset-Form actions in PDF documents with [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

A [Submit-Form action](https://api.docotic.com/pdfsubmitformaction) transmits the names and values of associated controls to a specified uniform resource identifier (URI). A corresponding web server will process them and send back a response.

A [Reset-Form action](https://api.docotic.com/pdfresetformaction) resets associated controls to their default values.

Please use [PdfControlAction.AddControl method](https://api.docotic.com/pdfcontrolaction-addcontrol) to associate a control with a Submit-Form or a Reset-Form action.
