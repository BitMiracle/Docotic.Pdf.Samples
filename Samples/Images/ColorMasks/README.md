# Create color-key mask for PDF image in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to use PDF images with color-key masks. The code uses [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/) API.

## Description

When adding images, you can specify the color of pixels you would like transparent. Use overloads of the [PdfDocument.AddImage](https://api.docotic.com/pdfdocument-addimage) method with an argument of `PdfColor` type for that.
