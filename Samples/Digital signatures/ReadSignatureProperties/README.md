# Read PDF signature properties in C# and VB.NET
This sample shows how to read PDF signature and corresponding certificates properties.

The library can read digital signature properties like name of the signer, the time of signing, the signer's contact info. It is also possible to access the signing certificate embedded in the signature. The issuer certificate for the signing certificate can also be retrieved, if it's embedded in the signature.
