# Read signature properties
This sample shows how to read signature and corresponding certificates properties.

The library can read signature properties like name of the signer, the time of signing, the signer's contact info. It is also possible to access the signing certificate embedded in the signature. The issuer certificate for the signing certificate can also be retrieved, if it's embedded in the signature.
