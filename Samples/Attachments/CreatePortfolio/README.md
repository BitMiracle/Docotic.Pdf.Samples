# Create PDF portfolio in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to create a PDF portfolio using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

PDF portfolios allow you to combine multiple files into one PDF document.
Use the PdfDocument.Collection property to enable the PDF portfolio view.

The PdfCollectionSettings.InitialDocument property defines the attached document to display
when the portfolio is opened in a conforming PDF reader. You can use Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader,
or PDF-XChange Editor to view PDF portfolios.
