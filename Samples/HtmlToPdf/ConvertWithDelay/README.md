# Convert HTML to PDF with delay in C# or VB.NET
This sample shows how to delay an HTML to PDF conversion in C# or VB.NET application.

There are cases when you might want to delay an HTML to PDF conversion. For example, when you want to convert a page, that executes a script after loading. 

For such cases, you can set up the delay in [conversion start options](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/help/conversionstartoptions.html) inside the HtmlConversionOptions. Then pass the options to the CreatePdfAsync method.

This sample code uses free [Docotic.Pdf.HtmlToPdf add-on](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BitMiracle.Docotic.Pdf.HtmlToPdf/) for Docotic.Pdf library.
