# Convert ASPX to PDF in C# and VB.NET

This sample shows how to generate a PDF from an ASPX page in an ASP.NET Web Forms application.

## Description

The ability to create a PDF version of an HTML view is a common requirement for ASP.NET applications that provide invoices, reports, or other statements to users.

Instead of recreating the document from scratch using a PDF library API, you can leverage existing work by simply converting the HTML that the ASP.NET engine generates after executing server-side code and controls.

This sample code uses Docotic.Pdf together with the [free HtmlToPdf add-on](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BitMiracle.Docotic.Pdf.HtmlToPdf/).
