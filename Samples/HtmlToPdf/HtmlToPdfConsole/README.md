# HTML to PDF conversion in C# or VB.NET console app
This sample shows how to convert a URL to PDF in C# or VB.NET console application.

The [HTML to PDF C# Conversion](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/html-pdf/#basics) section contains additional information.

## Description

The [HTML to PDF API](https://api.docotic.com/htmltopdf/bitmiracle-docotic-pdf-htmltopdf) is an asynchronous-only one. Nonetheless, it is possible to use the API from a regular synchronous console application. And if you are using C# 7.1 or newer, you can have an async Main in your console application.

This sample code uses free [Docotic.Pdf.HtmlToPdf add-on](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BitMiracle.Docotic.Pdf.HtmlToPdf/) for Docotic.Pdf library.
