# Hello, HTML to PDF in C# or VB.NET console app
This sample shows how to convert a URL to PDF in C# or VB.NET console application.

The [HTML to PDF API](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/help/bitmiracle.docotic.pdf.htmltopdf.html) is an asynchronous-only one. Nonetheless, it is possible to use the API from a regular synchronous console application. And if you are using C# 7.1 or newer, you can have an async Main in your console application. 

This sample code uses free [Docotic.Pdf.HtmlToPdf add-on](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BitMiracle.Docotic.Pdf.HtmlToPdf/) for Docotic.Pdf library.
