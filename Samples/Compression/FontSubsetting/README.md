# Subset PDF fonts in C# and VB.NET
This sample shows how to optimize fonts in PDF documents using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/).

## Description

Use [PdfDocument.RemoveUnusedFontGlyphs methods](https://api.docotic.com/pdfdocument-removeunusedfontglyphs) to optimize PDF fonts. These methods remove unused glyphs from the fonts and can significantly reduce output file size.
