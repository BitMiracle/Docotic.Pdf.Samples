# Print PDF in Eto.Forms applications
This C# sample shows how to print PDF documents to a printer in [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) applications.

The demo application allows you to print PDF documents on Windows, Linux, and macOS using [Docotic.Pdf library](https://bitmiracle.com/pdf-library/). The app shows very basic functionality because of the Eto.Forms limitations.
